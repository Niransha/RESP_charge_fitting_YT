why we doing charge fitting : 
to transfer charges easily between common functional groups.
also to ensure that rotationally degenerate atoms,have equivalent (equal in value) charges. (such as methyl and methylene hydrogens) 
 
"Previously, the major weaknesses of these charges have been that they were not easily transferable between common functional groups in related molecules," 

" they (charges) have often been conformationally dependent, and the large charges that frequently occur can be problematic for simulating intramolecular interactions. Introducing restraints in the form of a penalty function into the fitting process considerably reduces the above problems ..."

Hello Guys, I'm going to bring you some advance Amber tutotial, 
lets have a look first, 

we have 4 sections, 

lets start, 

i'm reading this article live, so you can skip, whenever you want,

In AMBER the method used for charge derivation is called the Restrained Electrostatic Potential (RESP) method. 

we can do same type of calculaton in Gaussian too,  HF/6-31G* QM - gaussian 

There are several options for charge fitting in AMBER. 
Antechamber - single ligand 
and RESP - Antechamber has not desicnged to handle bonded residues, or rotationally degenerate atoms

this tutorial is all about charge fitting 

i'm gonna pause when i read and come back for something imortant !

	0.1 before we can do this we need to deal with the bond that would normally link the dye to the linker.
	1. First we need to optimize the geometry, 
	2. then we need to generate an electrostatic potential 
	3. finally we need to run the RESP procedure.

	note that these sum to zero charge in each case.

#################################
i) Optimize Geometry
#################################

The first stage is to optimize our capped dye. This needs to be done o capping groups with the charges that they are assigned in the AMBER FF9X force fields. You should note that theswith a QM method at a reasonably high level of theory. MP2/6-31G* to optimize 

Investigations showed that the dye has two minima that are in different conformations but equivalent in energy. 

lets look into gaussian input files, 

Gaussian to pdb > using 
	1. Newzmat 
	2. WebMO
	3. Babel -- I'll show you how to use babel


first install babel, 
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y babel

babel [-i<input-type>] <name> [-o<output-type>] <name>

To see a list of recognized file formats use
  babel -L formats


so many formats

babel -ig09 floF_opt.gout -opdb aa.pdb

babel is easy :)

How to find Gaussian optimize coordinates ? this is a big file contain 19852 columns
o capping groups with the charges that they are assigned in the AMBER FF9X force fields. You should note that thes
this molecule has optimized...

if you use Joe, use K+F to find then type Conv, press enter once , then ctrl+L will make you jump to next "converge" location. 


these are the coordinates, 

the terminal i'm using called terminator...

###########################################
ii) Calculate Electrostatic Potential
#############################################


#P HF/6-31G* SCF=Tight Pop=MK IOp(6/33=2,6/41=10,6/42=17)

IOp 6/33=2 makes Gaussian write out the potential points and the potentials - Do not change.
IOp 6/41=10 specifies that 10 concentric layers of points are used for each atom.
IOp 6/42=17 specifies the density points in each layer - 17 gives 2500 points per atom


Note that the use of 6/41=10 and 6/42=17 is specific to this project in order to increase the number of grid points that Gaussian produces. this sentence is bit complex, gaussian create some layers over a molecule when we do charge fitting, those layers can be consider as a grid, 
those are parameters of this layer,

most 'standard' RESP fits these should not be included and just the IOp(6/33=2) is needed.

Geom=check , used to refer the optimized structure from *.chk file, so no need to input coordinates again 


This is basically for now, we do Optimize Geometry using MP2/6-31G* OR B3LYP/6-31G* we get optimized coordinates...
then using those coordinates,, we do Calculate Electrostatic Potential, This is somethisn I kind of do not know by now , lets check the output file. 

this Electrostatic Potentia output file is totaly charging stuff, with 190000+ lines :O

next step is fitting those charges to pdb , lets see whats happening, 

#####################################################
iii) Convert the Gaussian ESP data into the RESP format
######################################################

Okay guys , see this, 
I think this ESP fit center are grid points,
atomic centers are atom locations
not sure what is that 1 2 3 4 etc..
lets look at spaces after Fit 
there are so many things here, but for now skip that part, I think I need to look into gaussin manual 

okay everything is explained here,
 
 %%%%%%%%%%%%
	## RESP only reads in ESP data in a specific file format. To convert from the Gaussian output format to the RESP input format, we will use the following script:
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%
	esp.sh
	#!/bin/csh
	xlf /usr/local/apps/amber9/src/resp/readit.f
	grep "Atomic Center " $1 > a
	grep "ESP Fit" $1 > b
	grep "Fit    " $1 > c
	./a.out 
	rm -f a b c a.out readit.o
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

we get a file with line numbers, 

nl floB_hf.gout > floB_hf.gout_line_numbers

	%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	Atomic Center    1 is at   7.127640   .120744  -.032564
	Atomic Center    2 is at   7.345002  -.099693 -1.079630
	...
	Atomic Center    42 is at  -4.823702  2.342669  -.413287
	ESP Fit Center   43 is at   7.127640   .120744  2.067436
	...
	ESP Fit Center **** is at  -6.585767  1.848962 -2.848473
	ESP Fit Center **** is at  -6.502128  1.613625 -2.848473
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


>./esp.sh floB_hf.gout
enter natom,nesp:

count attomic ceners manually, 

let the machine serch for this readit.f file and continue on this
some search terms for you...
sudo find . -print | grep -i readit
grep -R "readit"

need to fix the codes but do not know where the files are located, :/

We can now run the esp.sh:

>./esp.sh floB_hf.gout
enter natom,nesp:

So we enter 42, 94681.


however this code will output these floB_esp.dat, floF_esp.dat


cat floB_esp.dat floF_esp.dat > floBF_esp.dat 

here floB_esp.dat then floF_esp.dat append to floBF_esp.dat 


######################################
iv) Generate the input files for RESP
######################################

normally carries out a RESP fit in two stages.
	1. first stage all atoms are allowed to vary							######################################
	2. in a second stage all degenerate hydrogen atoms are constrained to have equal charge and refit
    ################################ we dont have methyl or methylene groups here, so, no second stage
																##it has an NME methyl group, already fixed

we want to do a ***multiconformational RESP *** fit since we have the two similar states.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
 first stage 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

#### file - section 1 ### 	
 nmol=2,
 ihfree=1,
 qwt=0.0005,
 iqopt=2,
 /


nmol=2 RESP - multiconformational fit over two 'molecules' (two conformations of the dye).
ihfree=1 weak restraint on the heavy atoms.
qwt=0.0005 Strength of the restraint in A.U.
iqopt=2 tells RESP to read in initial charges from a *.in file in the form of Lagrange constraints. This is so we can fix the NME "LIKE" cap charges.


#### file - section 2 ### 

1.0   ←weighting factor

The first value (1.0) is a weighting factor for the multi-molecule fit
next line (floB) is just an identifier comment.
In this case we set it to 1.0 for both since we want them weighted equally.
## I'm trying to deal with RNA so it should be -1, so later I can add some ions to the system and neutralize, 


line specifying the total charge and the number of atoms (-2   42).
in the same order as in the QM calculation.

*** N=-1 then it tells RESP that this atom's charge should be read from the qin file and constrained to this value
*** A 0 means that it is free to change
*** a positive integer allows you to specify that two atoms have the same charge (use in the second stage of the fit)

Note for those entries that are not zero there must be an equivalent -1 in the RESP input file.



We need, atom 11 = same charge as atom 10,

10 --> 0 → charge change 
11 --> 10 charge as 11 atom has charge of 10

1.2) Charge Derivation for the Linker
###################################################
#######################

Alright everyone we are now at second stage .. 
I kind of understood whats happening here, 
also 
I change the description document a bit, 

Here they try to attached Linker and DNA together, when we do that, 
according to force feilds .. 

# atomic number | the second column is N. N = -1, 0 or a positive integer
In the AMBER FF99 force field standard 'internal' dna (and rna) residues have an integer charge of -1. 

5' residue charge = -0.3079
3' residue charge = -0.6921 TOTAL = -1

when we looks at figure, we see that 5' --- linker and 3' suger .. 

so, 

5' residue charge ( linker ) of -0.3079 --> modify this part to be in -0.3079 >through RESP fitting
3' residue charge of -0.6921 ( already defined)

RESP fitting is used to distribute charges .. 

insted of using all the sugar pucker, we can use a methyl group-attached to phospate..
it has disscussed on .. 
Cieplak, P., Cornell, W.D., Bayly, C., Kollman, P.A., J.Comp.Chem., 1995, 16(11), 1357-1377 (pdf)
https://ambermd.org/tutorials/advanced/tutorial1/files/DNA_Resp_fits.pdf


need to constrain the atoms of the cap (PO2-O-CH3) = -0.6921 to represent 3' end

#The capping group (PO2-O-CH3) was then constrained to give a total charge of -0.6921. 

#The methyl group was allowed to be freely fit 
(within the group constraint) 

#since there is no equivalent in the FF99SB force field set that we could fix them to

ACE = nutral = 0 
 entire construct = -1 , therefore , linker is -0.3079

second section of the file is slightly more complicated that the first stage.

set everything that is not a methyl or methylene hydrogen / carbon to be fixed (-1) and read from the qin file.

	okay in next stage we will combine linker and dye, so many steps, I think we are doing a research haha :D 
see you in next vedio...
